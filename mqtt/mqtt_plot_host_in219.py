Get measurement results from microphyton board and plot on host computer.
Use in combination with mqtt_plot_mpy.py.
Install paho MQTT client and matplotlib on host , e.g.
$ pip install pahoâˆ’mqtt
$ pip install matplotlib
Start this program first on the host from a terminal prompt , e.g.
$ python mqtt_plot_host.py
then run mqtt_plot_mpy.py on the ESP32.
